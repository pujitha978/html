             <p><i>Prolonged use of social media has been increasingly linked to a range of mental health issues, particularly among teenagers and young adults. One of the most significant concerns is the rise in anxiety and depression, as constant exposure to idealized images and the "perfect" lives of others can create unrealistic expectations and feelings of inadequacy. Social media platforms, with their carefully curated posts, often present a version of life that appears flawless, leading individuals to compare their own experiences unfavorably. This constant comparison can result in feelings of low self-worth, exacerbating mental health struggles and contributing to the rise of fear of missing out (FOMO). As users scroll through their feeds, they may feel left out of exciting experiences, further fueling anxiety and depression.</i></p>
